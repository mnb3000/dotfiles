Description: lesspipe.sh is an input filter for the pager less.
 lesspipe.sh is a sophisticated version to enhance less. It is able to process
 a wide variety of file formats. It enables users to deeply inspect archives
 and to display the contents of files in archives without having to unpack
 them before. That means file contents can be properly interpreted even if
 the files are compressed and contained in a hierarchy of archives (often
 found in RPM or DEB archives containing source tarballs). The filter is
 easily extensible for new formats. The input filter is a bash script, but
 works as well as a zsh script. For zsh and bash a completion mechanism for
 archive contents is provided.
