The file lesspipe.spec is a template to create a lesspipe RPM package.
After creating the required build directory structure, putting a
lesspipe-xxx.tar.gz into the SOURCES and lesspipe.spec into the SPECS
directories the RPM can be built by

rpmbuild -ba SPECS/lesspipe.spec

This template not copy the files INSTALL, README.md and the test suite,
that could go into a lesspipe-dev package.

Similarly the file control is a template for bulding a DEB package. The
installed size is not the correct number. It would be nice to have
complete building istructions here, but this requires the setup of
a building environment and is not described here.
